# Deployment 

## Prerequisites

- An Amazon EC2 instance.
- Basic knowledge of Unix commands.

## Service Management Commands

These commands are useful for managing the services.

### Service Commands for Gunicorn:

- Stop Gunicorn service: `sudo systemctl stop gunicorn.service`
- Start Gunicorn service: `sudo systemctl start gunicorn.service`
- Check Gunicorn service status: `sudo systemctl status gunicorn.service`

### Service Commands for Nginx:

- Start Nginx: `sudo systemctl start nginx`
- Restart Nginx: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
- Reload Nginx: `sudo systemctl reload nginx`
- Check Nginx status: `sudo systemctl status nginx`

## Setting Up Amazon EC2

1.**Start an EC2 instance**: Log into your AWS console and start a new EC2 instance.

2.**Retrieve Public IP**: Once your instance is running, note down the public IPv4 address.

3.**Configure Inbound Rules**:

- Go to the EC2 dashboard.
- Navigate to 'Security Groups' and modify the 'Inbound Rules'.
- Add a custom TCP rule to allow traffic on port 8000.

## Deploying the React Front-End

1.**Install and Update Nginx**:

- Update the package lists: `sudo apt-get update`
- Install Nginx: `sudo apt-get install nginx`

2.**Configure Nginx for React**:

- Create a configuration file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available`. Example content:

  ```nginx

  server {

      listen 80;

      server_name [your_public_ip];


      location = /favicon.ico {

          access_log off;

          log_not_found off;

      }

      location /media/ {

          root /var/www/[your_project_folder]/petpal;

      }

      location / {

          root /var/www/[your_project_folder]/my-app/build;

          try_files $uri /index.html;

      }

  }

  ```
- Replace `[your_public_ip]` and `[your_project_folder]` with your actual IP address and project directory.

3.**Enable the Site**:

- Create a symbolic link to enable the site:

`ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/[app_config] /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/[config]`

## Setting Up the Django Backend

1.**Configure Django**:

- Add your serverâ€™s IP address to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py`.
- Example:

  ```python

  ```

 ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your_public_ip', 'localhost']

    ```

- Update `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `settings.py`.
- Example:

  ```python

  ```

 CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [

"http://localhost:3000",

"http://127.0.0.1:3000",

"http://your_public_ip",

 ]

    ```

2.**Install and Configure Gunicorn**:

- Install Gunicorn: `pip install gunicorn`
- Run Gunicorn in the parent folder of `wsgi.py`: `gunicorn [your_project_name].wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000`
- Replace `[your_project_name]` with the name of your Django project.

After following these steps, your React application should be accessible via your EC2 instance's public IP on port 80, and your Django application on port 8000. Remember to replace placeholders like `[your_public_ip]`, `[your_project_folder]`, and `[your_project_name]` with your actual details.
